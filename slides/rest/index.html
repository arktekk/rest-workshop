    <h1>REST</h1>
  </section>
  <section>
    
    <h1>History</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>First Coined by Roy T. Fielding in his dissertation</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes"> While developing HTTP/1.1, Fielding also wrote his PhD dissertation. REST is the example in his dissertation.</aside>

    <h2>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</h2>
    <h3>Describes constraints used to obtain certain properties</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Example Architectural Styles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>REST</li>
      <li>Pipe And Filter</li>
      <li>RPC</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Connector</h1>
    <h3>Software that communicates with the network. Typically a HTTP server, or HTTP Client</h3>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Component</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Server</li>
      <li>Client</li>
      <li>Intermediary</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Software which is part of the networked system. Any Piece of software within a restful architecture is
      a Component.</aside>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Resource</h1>

    <aside class="notes">this is what you should think the most of when you are designing a RESTful architecture. 
Think in nouns not verbs. What IS it? Not What can I do with it.</aside>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Resource</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Books</li>
      <li>Products</li>
      <li>Articles</li>
      <li>Ads</li>
      <li>Images</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Representation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding of resource state transmitted over the network</li>
      <li>A Resource MAY have multiple representations</li>
      <li>Hypermedia format</li>
      <li>In HTTP the representation is both the body and the headers of a message (httpbis)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">A representation is an encoding of the resource state, served over the network. 
A representation is also known as a hypermedia format or Media Type. 
This will be explained in detail later.

    <h1>Constraints</h1>

  </section>
<section>
  <img src="one/client-server.gif" alt="Client Server"/>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Uniform Interface</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifying resources using URIs</li>
    <li>Manipulation of resources through representations</li>
    <li>Self-descriptive messaging</li>
  </ul>
<aside class="notes">The same methods are available everywhere.</aside>
</section>
<section>
  <pre style="font-size:0.83em">
interface Resource {
  URI id;
  Representation process(Representation r);
  Representation update(Representation r);
  Representation download();
  Representation remove();
}

  </pre>

</section>
<section>
<h1>Stateless protocol</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Request must be self-contained</li>
  <li>No server-side temporary state (HTTP Session)</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">Everything that the server needs to satisfy the request must be part of the request.
Authentication, freshness rules, Which resource is being requested, capabilities of the agent.</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h1>Layered System</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Caching</li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Transparent to the network</li>
  <li>Network Components may be added after deployment</li>

<aside class="notes">Layered System. Since we are using HTTP, we get this for free.  This means that Components may be injected into the 
network stack to offload origin servers, or add capabilities of their own. For instance Security.
</aside>
</section>
<section>
<h1>Caching</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Makes REST Scale</li>
  <li>Part of the layered system</li>
  <li>May be placed anywhere in the network stack</li>
  <li>Use client-caches</li>

  <aside class="notes">Important part for scalability. Caches may be placed anywhere in the stack. As we remember 
  from the HTTP talk, caching means that polling works fine.</aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Code on Demand (optional)</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Adds additional capabilities to an Agent, by downloding code</li>
    <li>Browsers, JavaScript</li>
    <li>ScalaScript</li>
    <li>Python</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">An Agent may download additional code to be able to add new capabilities for the Agent.
  In browsers this means javascript.</aside>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Elevating data as a first-class architectural element</h2>

<aside class="notes">Since we need to care about data, the structure of data and how it should be operated upon, becomes important. 
Structure becomes important, the data needs to be parsed, and contain something that lets clients know
how to operate on those data.</adata>
</section>
<section>
<h1>HATEOAS</h1>
<h3>"The scary part of REST"</h3>
</section>
<section>
<h2> Hypertext as the engine of application state </h2>

<aside class="notes">to be able to understand this sentence, one must first understand what hypertext means. 
Then you need to understand what application means. And lastly understanding what engine in this context means.</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h1>The "link" constraint</h1>

<aside class="notes">This is something that "restafarians" keep scaring people with. Basically this can be thought of (click)</aside>
</section>
<section>
<h1>LINKS</h1>
<pre>
    
&lt;a href="http://example.com"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://static.example.com/1.css"/&gt;

&lt;script href="http://static.example.com/1234.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<aside class="notes"> as Links, or hyperlink. Forms are also useful hypertext controls, but we will get back to that later.</aside>
</section>
<section>

<h1>Why are links important</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Links helps decouple server and client. </li>
  <li>A Component does not need to know how the server works internally.</li>
  <li>Intent can be expressed in a link.</li>
  <li>Links helps REST scale</li>

<aside class="notes">Navigation in a result set, for instance pagination, filtering of result sets, creating new items in a collection. etc.</aside>
</section>
<section>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Search</li>
  <li>Pagination</li>
  <li>Filtering</li>
  <li>Creating new items in a collection.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Use links to let your client application know what is possible to do next </h2>

<aside class="notes"> Links may take many forms and sizes, We will return to this subject later.</aside>

</section>
<section>
<h2>MUD Example</h2>
<pre style="font-size:0.8em">
You are in a room, there is a wizard here. 
There are exits to the NORTH, SOUTH and EAST.
There is an empty whisky BOTTLE on the floor. 
You can hear the wizard snoring.
    
What would you like to do> GO NORTH    
</pre>    
<aside class="notes"> Anyone seen something like this? *Hands* 
This can be thought of a representation with links to NORTH, SOUTH, EAST.
You could always try to GO another direction, like WEST, the MUD server would then
give you an error message. There would be a limited set of operations the player could use, so
this would map to the Uniform interface. You could for instance try to PICK UP NORTH.
