Arktekk's REST Workshop
=======================

This material is a two day workshop on REST. It is divided into three
areas: slides for an instructor, exercises for the participants and
instructor's notes.

The slides cover the theoretical aspects of REST and HTTP. They form
the basis for discussions and exercises.

Exercises for getting hands on with REST and HTTP. The exercises are
practical and directly useful afterwards. The exercises takes you from
a basic "RPC over HTTP" application to a good HTTP component.

There is a whole lot of information on what REST and is and is not,
but we're trying to introduce you to REST through a practical examples
and exercises. As REST is not a single architecture but rather an
architectonic style, we can only show you some ways to use this style.
We're doing this through discussions during and after the
presentations. You'll try yourself in the exercises.
