Participant Requirements
========================

Each participant needs to have these tools installed:

* node.js and npm. All the exercises use node.js.
* MongoDB
* git to clone this repository
* curl - a command line HTTP client. Useful for scripting and
  debugging http servers

Node.js and NPM
---------------

### Linux

Linux users can install binaries through their distribution's package
repository.

### OS X and Windows

For OS X and Windows we recommend using the binaries that are
available for download from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/download/).

MongoDB
-------

### Linux

Linux users can install binaries through their distribution's package
repository.

### OSX

For OS X, MongoDB is available through MacPorts, Homebrew and as
binary downloads from <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>. Choose the
binary download unless you're already familiar with MacPorts or
Homebrew.

Follow the instructions on
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/> for
instructions in any case.

### Windows

For Windows use the binaries available from
<http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>. Follow the instructions on
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/>.
You do not need to install it as a Windows Service.


Git
---

### Linux

Linux users can install binaries through their distribution's package
repository.

### Windows

There are generic git binaries available from
<http://git-scm.com/downloads> but we recommend using [GitHub for
Windows](http://windows.github.com/) as it includes a GUI in addition
to the normal command line tools.

GitHub for Windows also includes curl so you don't have to install
curl.

### OS X

There are generic git binaries available from
<http://git-scm.com/downloads> but we recommend using [GitHub for
Mac](http://mac.github.com/) as it includes a GUI in addition to the
normal command line tools.

curl
----

### Linux

Linux users can install binaries through their distribution's package
repository.

### OS X

Curl is shipped with OS X.

### Windows

For Windows you can download curl with Cygwin if you're already using
Cygwin. If not, download the binaries from
[curl.haxx.se](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html). Search for "win32"
or "win64" depending on your platform.
